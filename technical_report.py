**Existing System Architecture**

{company_name} currently operates on a traditional monolithic architecture deployed on on-premises infrastructure. The technology stack includes legacy application servers running on virtualized environments, relational databases with limited replication capabilities, and manual data processing workflows that require significant human intervention.

The current architecture consists of web application servers, middleware layers for business logic processing, and database servers operating in a primary-secondary configuration. Network architecture utilizes traditional firewall-based security with limited automation capabilities.

**Performance Baseline Metrics**

Current system performance metrics indicate average API response times of 2.5 seconds under normal load conditions, with peak throughput limited to 100 requests per second. CPU utilization averages 75% during business hours, with memory usage consistently above 80% on production servers. Error rates spike to 5% during peak loads, primarily due to database connection pool exhaustion and timeout issues.

Database query performance shows degradation as data volumes grow, with complex analytical queries taking 30-45 seconds to complete. System availability stands at 99.2%, falling short of target SLAs of 99.9%.

**Identified Limitations**

The existing infrastructure faces significant scalability constraints due to vertical scaling limitations and lack of horizontal scaling capabilities. Manual deployment processes increase deployment time to 2-3 hours with elevated risk of configuration errors. Legacy code architecture makes it difficult to implement modern microservices patterns or cloud-native features.

Database query performance degrades with data volume growth, and the current backup and disaster recovery strategy requires 4-6 hours for full restoration. Integration capabilities are limited by point-to-point connections that create maintenance overhead.""",
            
            'target_architecture_design': f"""TARGET ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

**Recommended AWS Architecture**

The proposed architecture leverages modern AWS managed services to address current limitations and provide scalable, resilient infrastructure. Core components include Amazon ECS for containerized application workloads, Application Load Balancer for intelligent traffic distribution, Amazon RDS Aurora for the database layer with read replicas, and Amazon Bedrock for GenAI capabilities.

The architecture implements a multi-tier design with clear separation between presentation, application, and data layers. Amazon CloudFront CDN provides edge caching and global content delivery. AWS Lambda functions handle event-driven processing and background tasks. Amazon S3 serves as the foundation for data lakes and static asset storage.

API Gateway manages all external API traffic with built-in throttling, authentication, and monitoring capabilities. The architecture utilizes Amazon ElastiCache Redis for session management and application caching to reduce database load.

**Component Specifications**

Compute layer utilizes ECS Fargate with task definitions allocating 4 vCPU and 8GB memory per container. Auto-scaling policies maintain 2-10 tasks based on CPU utilization and request count metrics. Application Load Balancer distributes traffic across availability zones with health check intervals of 30 seconds.

Database tier implements Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition with db.r6g.xlarge instances providing 4 vCPUs and 32GB memory. Multi-AZ deployment ensures automatic failover within 60 seconds. Read replicas in each availability zone handle reporting and analytical workloads.

**Scalability and Performance**

Auto-scaling policies respond to CloudWatch metrics with scale-out triggers at 70% CPU utilization and scale-in at 30% utilization. Horizontal scaling adds capacity within 2-3 minutes of threshold breach. Load balancer connection draining ensures graceful instance termination.

ElastiCache Redis clusters provide sub-millisecond response times for frequently accessed data. CloudFront edge locations cache static content and API responses with configurable TTL policies reducing origin load by 60-70%.

**Security Architecture**

VPC design implements public and private subnets across three availability zones. NAT Gateways enable outbound internet access from private subnets while maintaining security isolation. Security groups enforce least-privilege access with explicit allow rules for required traffic only.

IAM roles and policies follow principle of least privilege with fine-grained permissions. All data encrypts at rest using AWS KMS with customer-managed keys. TLS 1.3 enforces encryption in transit for all external communications. AWS WAF protects against common web exploits and bot traffic.""",
            
            'data_strategy_requirements': f"""DATA STRATEGY & REQUIREMENTS

**Data Sources and Integration**

Primary data sources include internal operational databases, third-party REST APIs for external data enrichment, and file-based data feeds delivered via SFTP. Real-time event streams from application logs and user interactions feed into the analytics pipeline.

Integration approach implements event-driven architecture using Amazon EventBridge for routing events to appropriate processing functions. AWS Lambda functions transform and validate data before storage. Step Functions orchestrate complex multi-step data processing workflows.

**Data Quality and Preparation**

Data validation pipelines implement schema validation, data type checking, and business rule validation before accepting data into the system. AWS Glue DataBrew provides visual data preparation capabilities for cleansing and normalization.

Data quality monitoring tracks completeness, accuracy, and consistency metrics with automated alerting for anomalies. Duplicate detection and resolution processes run during data ingestion to maintain data integrity.

**Storage and Processing Architecture**

Data lake implemented on Amazon S3 with organized bucket structure separating raw, processed, and curated data zones. S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically optimizes storage costs based on access patterns. Lifecycle policies archive infrequently accessed data to Glacier after 90 days.

AWS Glue Catalog maintains metadata and schema registry enabling data discovery and governance. Glue ETL jobs process data transformations using Apache Spark with auto-scaling worker allocation. Amazon Athena provides SQL query capabilities directly against S3 data lake.

**Data Governance Framework**

Data classification tags all datasets as public, internal, confidential, or restricted based on sensitivity. IAM policies and S3 bucket policies enforce access controls aligned with classification levels. CloudTrail logs all data access for audit purposes with retention of 7 years for compliance requirements.""",

**Model Comparison Methodology**

Evaluation framework tests models across four key dimensions: accuracy, latency, cost, and scalability. Benchmark dataset includes 10,000 representative queries spanning common use cases with ground truth annotations verified by domain experts.

Testing infrastructure provisions isolated environments for each model with identical compute resources to ensure fair comparison. Load testing simulates production traffic patterns with gradual ramp-up to maximum capacity. Cost analysis calculates per-request expenses including compute, API calls, and data transfer.

**Performance Testing Results**

Claude Sonnet 4.5 achieved 94% accuracy on benchmark dataset with average latency of 800ms and p95 latency of 1.2 seconds. Token processing throughput reached 150 tokens per second with consistent performance under load. Cost per request averaged $0.008 based on typical prompt and response lengths.

Claude Haiku delivered 89% accuracy with significantly faster average latency of 200ms and p95 of 350ms. Token processing throughput exceeded 400 tokens per second making it ideal for high-volume scenarios. Cost per request of $0.003 provides 60% cost reduction compared to Sonnet.

Testing revealed Claude Sonnet 4.5 excels at complex reasoning tasks requiring multi-step analysis, while Haiku performs optimally for straightforward classification and extraction tasks. Both models demonstrated excellent reliability with error rates below 0.1%.

**Recommended Models and Rationale**

Primary recommendation deploys Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all complex analysis, decision support, and content generation tasks where accuracy takes priority over speed. The model's superior reasoning capabilities justify the moderate latency and cost premium for business-critical operations.

Claude Haiku serves as the recommended model for high-volume routine operations including data extraction, classification, and simple query responses. The combination of fast response times and lower cost makes it ideal for user-facing interactive features requiring sub-second response times.

**Fine-tuning and Optimization Plans**

Prompt engineering optimization will refine system prompts to maximize accuracy while minimizing token usage. A/B testing framework compares prompt variations to identify highest-performing templates. Prompt caching reduces latency and cost for frequently used prompt patterns.

Response caching implements intelligent cache with 15-minute TTL for deterministic queries. Cache hit rate projections of 40-50% will significantly reduce API costs and improve response times. Batch processing aggregates similar requests to maximize throughput for background operations.""",

**Phase 4: Deployment (Month 8)**

Production deployment strategy implements blue-green deployment pattern enabling zero-downtime releases. Infrastructure provisioning creates production VPC, database clusters, and application containers. DNS cutover to new environment occurs after validation of all health checks.

Monitoring and alerting configuration establishes CloudWatch dashboards tracking key metrics including API latency, error rates, and resource utilization. X-Ray distributed tracing provides detailed performance analysis. PagerDuty integration enables 24/7 incident response.

Final security validation conducts production security scan, validates backup and disaster recovery procedures, and confirms compliance with security policies. Penetration testing against production environment ensures no vulnerabilities introduced during deployment.

Go-live preparation includes runbook reviews with operations team, communication plan for stakeholders, and rollback procedures in case of issues. On-call rotation schedule ensures coverage during initial stabilization period.

Key deliverables include production environment operational with initial traffic, complete monitoring and alerting configured, validated backup and disaster recovery procedures, and documented rollback procedures.

**Phase 5: Stabilization and Optimization (Month 9-10)**

Post-deployment monitoring phase intensively tracks system behavior under production load. Daily review of metrics identifies trends and potential issues. Capacity planning analyzes growth trends to ensure adequate resources.

Performance tuning optimizes database queries based on production access patterns. Cache hit rates analysis identifies opportunities for expanded caching. Auto-scaling policies refinement right-sizes compute resources balancing cost and performance.

Knowledge transfer sessions train operations team on system architecture, troubleshooting procedures, and routine maintenance tasks. Documentation updates capture lessons learned and operational procedures. Runbook validation ensures operations team can handle common scenarios independently.

Handover to operations includes transition of on-call responsibilities, transfer of administrative access, and establishment of regular review meetings for continuous improvement.

Key deliverables include optimized system performance meeting all SLA targets, trained operations team capable of independent system management, comprehensive operational documentation, and formal handover sign-off.

**Resource Allocation**

Project team structure includes technical lead overseeing architecture and design decisions, three senior developers implementing core functionality, two DevOps engineers managing infrastructure and CI/CD, one QA engineer developing test automation, and one technical writer creating documentation.

Cloud architect provides part-time guidance on AWS best practices and architecture reviews. Security specialist conducts security assessments and penetration testing. Project manager coordinates activities and stakeholder communication.

**Testing Strategy**

Test automation framework implements tests at multiple levels including unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end tests for complete user workflows. Test coverage targets exceed 80% for critical business logic.

Performance test scenarios simulate realistic user behavior including gradual ramp-up, sustained load, and spike traffic patterns. Acceptance criteria require p95 latency under 1 second and error rate below 0.1% at target load.""",
            
            'integration_operations': f"""INTEGRATION & OPERATIONS

**System Integration Requirements**

APIs implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens providing secure stateless authentication. Token expiration and refresh mechanisms balance security and user experience. API rate limiting prevents abuse with tiered limits based on client tier.

RESTful endpoints follow OpenAPI 3.0 specifications with comprehensive documentation. Request and response payloads use JSON format with schema validation ensuring data integrity. API versioning strategy uses URL path versioning enabling backward compatibility.

Webhook integration enables real-time notifications to external systems for key events. Retry logic with exponential backoff ensures reliable delivery. Webhook signature validation authenticates sender identity.

**Monitoring and Observability**

CloudWatch dashboards provide real-time visibility into system health with key metrics including API request rate, error rate, response latency percentiles, database connections, and GenAI model invocation metrics. Custom metrics track business KPIs like successful transactions and user engagement.

AWS X-Ray distributed tracing provides detailed performance analysis showing request flow through microservices. Trace analysis identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Service map visualization displays dependencies and call patterns.

Log aggregation in CloudWatch Logs centralizes application and infrastructure logs. Log Insights queries enable rapid troubleshooting. Automated alarms trigger for error rate thresholds, latency degradation, and resource exhaustion scenarios.

**Maintenance and Support**

Patch management strategy applies security patches to operating systems and dependencies within 72 hours of release for critical vulnerabilities. Automated patching during maintenance windows minimizes manual effort. Change management process requires approval for infrastructure modifications.

Incident response procedures define severity levels, escalation paths, and resolution time targets. On-call rotation ensures 24/7 coverage with clear handoff procedures. Post-incident reviews capture lessons learned and prevention strategies.

SLA definitions specify 99.9% uptime target for production services with planned maintenance windows communicated 48 hours in advance. Performance SLAs require p95 API latency under 1 second and error rate below 0.5%.

**Operational Procedures**

Runbooks document common operational tasks including deployment procedures, database backup and restoration, scaling operations, and disaster recovery activation. Step-by-step instructions with screenshots ensure consistent execution.

Troubleshooting guides address common issues with symptoms, diagnostic steps, and resolution procedures. Decision trees help on-call engineers quickly identify root causes. Known issues database tracks recurring problems and workarounds.

Change management workflow requires peer review for infrastructure changes, testing in staging environment, and approval from technical lead before production deployment. Rollback procedures document steps to revert changes if issues arise. Deployment windows schedule changes during low-traffic periods to minimize impact."""
