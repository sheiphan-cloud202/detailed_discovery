    "primary-goal": "Transform our financial advisory services by implementing AI-powered investment analysis and personalized portfolio recommendations. We aim to reduce analysis time by 70%, improve accuracy to 95%+, and scale our advisory capacity 10x without proportional headcount increases. This will enable us to serve mid-market clients profitably while maintaining institutional-grade quality.",
    
    "business-problems": "Our financial advisory operations face critical challenges with real-time market analysis, portfolio optimization, and personalized client recommendations. Current manual processes require 4-6 hours per client analysis, limit our ability to respond to market changes quickly, and constrain our capacity to serve growing mid-market segment. Advisors spend 60% of time on data gathering and analysis rather than client relationships. We're losing market share to AI-native competitors who can deliver faster, more comprehensive analysis at lower cost.",
    
    "strategic-alignment": "This GenAI initiative directly supports our 2025-2027 strategic plan to become the leading AI-powered wealth management platform for high-net-worth and mid-market clients. The initiative aligns with three strategic pillars: (1) Digital transformation of advisory services, (2) Scaling operations to serve 100,000+ clients by 2027, (3) Achieving 40% cost-to-serve reduction while improving client satisfaction scores to 95%+.
